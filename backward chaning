connected(a, b).
connected(a, c).

% B is connected to D
connected(b, d).

% C is connected to E
connected(c, e).

% Rules for inference
% If X is connected to Y and Y is connected to Z, then X is indirectly connected to Z
indirectly_connected(X, Z) :-
    connected(X, Y),
    connected(Y, Z).

% Backward chaining predicate
% infer/2 uses connected/2 and indirectly_connected/2 to prove connections
infer(X, Z) :-
    connected(X, Z).
infer(X, Z) :-
    connected(X, Y),
    infer(Y, Z).

% Query to find if there is a connection from X to Z using backward chaining
connected_to(X, Z) :-
    infer(X, Z).
